# for every subset, you have to decide how many clusters you want to collapse.
# this process happens automatically and the script sequentially collapses the two most similar clusters - one collapse of two clusters at a time
# Every collapse step is numbered: 
#level 0: no collapse,
#level n: Collapse the two most similar clusters and renumber the remaining clusters. Repeat n-1 times.
# For the first run, set it to "max": the script will run a full collapse into one cluster per subset. 
# Choose then the collapse level for each subset: 
# collapse.levels <- c(0, "max", "max") # maximally collapse to two clusters. Check which collapse level fits and re-run with according number supplied.
collapse.levels <- c(0, 0, 0) # <- do not collapse anything, just pool the subsets back together
#collapse.levels <- c(x, y) # collapse closest pair of clusters in subset 1 x times, subset 2 y times iteratively

# Benchmarking the homogeneity of the subsets: we use an accuracy measure to return how homogeneity is lost during collapsing:
#  RMSD; sqrt 1/n sum (x-m)2
#  MAE; 1/n sum abs x-m
clusterhomogeneitymeasure <- "MAE" # better use MAE, which is less sensitive to outlier signals

# Adrian Huck hat ein anderes paket: fviz_nbclust {factoextra}. kmeans, ist also vielleicht suboptimal.


# After collapsing, or not by keeping collapse.levels at 0, the script will annotate the clusters
# other than the original code, you need to explicitly annotate a cluster as "other"!!!
# any un-annotated cluster will keep the three-digit number by the collapse-routine
# if you checked the annotation list down in stage 3, turn annotation on:
use.my.annotation.list <- FALSE # setting this to FALSE will skip the annotation and will just use the three-digit numbers after re-uniting the subsets

# After the annotation, check how each cluster is distributed within the markercomparision we used to set gate thresholds
# there is a chance that some clusters end up at the edge of the threshold and are therefore wrongly put in that subset: 
# e.g a cluster that is "false CD3 gated" would now show up just at the border of the CD3 gate.
# Clusters might end up in certain areas in the scatter plot, that is how clustering works, but you don't want to see a cluster sticking at the gate threshold:
# you might need to address such a cluster by either adjusting the gate thresholds, or removing it entirely already in stage 2
plot.cluster_wise.scatterplots <- 0

# Cluster annotations list.
# Watch out: You will annotate the clusters according to the numbers found in the STAGE2 First(Second) Pass (depending on whether you deleted some)
# Or depending on the numbers you find at the according collapse.level. This number is NOT the one you put in the list, but
# you need to add 100 to subset 1, 200 to subset 2. The code will re-unite the subsets first, giving cluster 3 of subset 2 the number 203. 
# This is the annotated number:
cluster.annots <- list()















# if you wish to see a heatmap&UMAP calculated over the entire dataset (after we re-united the subsets with three-digit number)
# Keep on 0, not sure why we did all the fuss with the gates if you wanna see the entire dataset, but be my guest.

# before we go on, we need to mask lymph nodes in the ROIs, since these provide a ton of cells to any spatial analysis.

# For now, we only consider masks that behave well, meaning that the mask itself covers maximally a certain percentage of the whole ROI

# You can either use a simple Binary Mask (creating inside.lymphnode flag) or you can use also here EDMs, that will give additional to inside.lymphnode a distance
lymphnode.mask.type <- "EDM" # use either EDM or BM. imageJ produces both for you...
# using EDM has the advantage that you can now extend the mask since you are probably missing a clear lymph node signal and the masks are not covering
# the t cell area that nicely 
# in this case, the script lets you extend the mask, and it will flag cells with a distance of x px also as inside.lymphnode:

# in the discussion with Birgit 20220422, also seeing the glucagon signal in Juliettes panel, we decide to extend our mask before
# calculating EDM. These here are in v1.1.0 and are extended by 9 iterations on count 1px:
#EDMpath <- c("D:/IMI/IMC/Western-diet/Analysis/Islet ImageJ EDM/EDM_imageJ_output_5IterationsDilate")

# now, cross-check with the .jpgs in this folder the following: 
# find an empty mask, which is all-blue and open the EDM.txt file. 
# imageJ puts a number for empty (no mask present), which was in my case 46341 (besides some of them having 0) 
# Adapt if necessary since we gonna skip masks that got this number in:
